'Danny Cahill stood, slightly dazed, in a blizzard of confetti as the audience screamed and his family ran on stage.When he got on the scale for all to see that evening, Dec.“I’ve got my life back,” he declared.” Mr. Cahill left the show’s stage in Hollywood and flew directly to New York to start a triumphal tour of the talk shows, chatting with Jay Leno, Regis Philbin and Joy Behar.Yet their experiences, while a bitter personal disappointment, have been a gift to science.They showed just how hard the body fights back against weight loss.“I am just blown away.When it ended, their metabolisms had slowed radically and their bodies were not burning enough calories to maintain their thinner sizes.So they were not surprised to see that “The Biggest Loser” contestants had slow metabolisms when the show ended.It was as if their bodies were intensifying their effort to pull the contestants back to their original weight.As he regained more than 100 pounds, his metabolism slowed so much that, just to maintain his current weight of 295 pounds, he now has to eat 800 calories a day less than a typical man his size.And that, said Dr. Michael Schwartz, an obesity and diabetes researcher who is a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, is “new and important.But maintaining weight loss is difficult, he said, which is why he tells contestants that they should exercise at least nine hours a week and monitor their diets to keep the weight off.The study’s findings, to be published on Monday in the journal Obesity, are part of a scientific push to answer some of the most fundamental questions about obesity.And they are looking afresh at medical care for obese people.Most people who have tried to lose weight know how hard it is to keep the weight off, but many blame themselves when the pounds come back.And while it is not known why that weight can change over the years  —   it may be an effect of aging  —   at any point, there is a weight that is easy to maintain, and that is the weight the body fights to defend.First, though, they are trying to understand them in greater detail.“If they don’t show a return to normal in metabolism, what hope is there for the rest of us?“There is a lot of basic research we still need to do,” said Dr. Margaret Jackson, who is directing a project at Pfizer.With weight loss, leptin levels fall and people become hungry.And she struggles mightily to keep the pounds off because her metabolism burns 552 fewer calories a day than would be expected for someone her size.“Two treats can turn into a binge over a   period.The researchers were concerned that the contestants might try to frantically lose weight before coming in, so they shipped equipment to them that would measure their physical activity and weight before their visit, and had the information sent remotely to the N. I. H. The contestants received their metabolic results last week.“All my friends were drinking beer and not gaining massive amounts of weight,” Mr. Cahill said.He went from 444 pounds to 289 as a contestant on the show.The investigators found at least one reason: plummeting levels of leptin.By the season’s finale, they had almost no leptin at all, which would have made them ravenous all the time.In a   study funded by Australia’s National Health and Medical Research Council, Dr. Joseph Proietto of the University of Melbourne and his colleagues recruited 50 overweight people who agreed to consume just 550 calories a day for eight or nine weeks.Dr. Proietto and his colleagues looked at leptin and four other hormones that satiate people.Its level rose.“The body puts multiple mechanisms in place to get you back to your weight.He would starve himself, and then eat a whole can of cake frosting with a spoon.Walking hurt stairs were agony.“I remember sitting in a dressing room one day, and nothing would fit.He tried three times and was finally selected.And rigorous it was.Eventually, he and the others were sent home for four months to try to keep losing weight on their own.The idea was to lose a pound a day.Have breakfast  —   typically one egg and two egg whites, half a grapefruit and a piece of sprouted grain toast.Rest for an hour.They wore compression undergarments to hold it in.He was so mentally and physically exhausted he barely moved for two weeks after his publicity tour ended.Soon the scale hit 265.He got back down to 235 to 240 pounds.Then I’d black out and eat the whole bag of chips and say, ‘What did I do?“These very small differences between intake and output average out to only about 10 to 20 calories per day  —   less than one Starburst candy  —   but the cumulative consequences over time can be devastating.He analyzed data from a clinical trial in which people took a diabetes drug, canagliflozin, that makes them spill 360 calories a day into their urine, or took a placebo.Those taking the drug gradually lost weight.And, he added, if people fought the urge to eat those calories, they would be hungry.All this does not mean that modest weight loss is hopeless, experts say.“The difficulty in keeping weight off reflects biology, not a pathological lack of willpower affecting   of the U. S. A. ,” he said.
