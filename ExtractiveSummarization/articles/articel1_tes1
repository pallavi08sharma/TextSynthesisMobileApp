India's history at the Winter Olympics is incomplete without the mention of six-time Winter Olympian Shiva Keshavan.

While almost all other Indian Winter Olympians have competed in ski-based sports, Shiva Keshavan introduced luge – a completely different sport – to the country’s winter sports fans. He qualified for his first Winter Games at the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan.

Aged just 16 back then, Shiva Keshavan also became the youngest luger to qualify for the Winter Olympics at the time. Shiva Keshavan has gone on to compete in five more Winter Olympics since then, making him the most-decorated Winter Olympian in Indian history.

Interestingly, at Sochi 2014, Shiva Keshavan competed under the (International Olympic Committee) IOC flag rather than the Indian tricolour.

Heading into the Sochi Games, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) was serving a ban and the three Indian athletes, including Shiva Keshavan, started the Games as Independent Olympic Participants (IOP).

However, the IOA was reinstated midway through the Sochi Games, which allowed the Indian athletes to finish the edition officially representing the Indian flag. But Shiva Keshavan had already finished his event before the ban was lifted and his results were recorded under IOP.

Shiva Keshavan retired after the 2018 Winter Games.

At Beijing 2022, Indian alpine skier Arif Mohammad Khan won quotas in both men’s slalom and giant slalom – making him the first Indian to qualify for two separate events directly. He finished 45th in giant slalom - the best-ever finish by any Indian in the event at the Winter Games but recorded a DNF in giant slalom.

India are yet to win a medal at the Winter Olympics.
